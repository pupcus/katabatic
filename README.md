# wunderground

This is a WIP (work in progress/under construction). This is some clojure code designed to access weather underground api data and explore it. I am learning about how to use third party apis that have json results.

## Usage

To use this program, you need to register at [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) and get a valid APIB key. Then create a .lein-env file in the project root directory and put something like this in it:

```clojure
{
 :wunderground
 {
  :key "YOUR-API-KEY-GOES-HERE"
 }
}
```

There are various 'data sets' that you can ask for from Weather Underground via their API.

For example, if you want to get tropical storms, you can get an Anvil Developer key, and then run this command:

```clojure
(weather-info [:currenthurricane])
```
The default format is JSON, so it will give you JSON output, but you can also give XML output:
```clojure
(weather-info [:currenthurricane] {:format "xml"}])
```
You can ask for more then one topic at a time though! See the API for more info on the topics you can use.

You must provide location information if you ask for anything besides hurricane info. For example:
```clojure
(weather-info [:conditions :alerts])
```
We have set it so that it will automatically choose your location (based on your IP) by default. But you can specify your location in many ways. Options include:
```clojure
;; lat/lon location
{:lat "38.976"
 :lon "-77.157"}

;; airport weather station
{:airport "KJFK"}

;; personal weather station
{:pws "KCASANFR70"}

;; US city and state
{:city "Anchorage" :state "AK"}

;; World country and city
{:city "Paris" :country "France"}

;; specific ip address (example is google's nameserver address)
{:ip "8.8.8.8"}
```
You can get latitude and longitude from [Google Maps](https://google.com/maps).
